# AI Glossary

## Common AI Terms and Definitions

**Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions given to an AI system to help it learn and make decisions.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn.

**Bias**: Systematic errors in AI systems that can lead to unfair outcomes, often reflecting historical inequalities in training data.

**Computer Vision**: A field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world.

**Data Mining**: The process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data.

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data.

**Feature**: An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed.

**Machine Learning**: A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, enabling systems to learn from data.

**Model**: A mathematical representation of a real-world process, trained on data to make predictions or decisions.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Neural Network**: A computing system inspired by biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes.

**Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, making it perform poorly on new data.

**Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.

**Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model finds patterns in data without labeled examples.

**Validation**: The process of checking that a model performs well on data it hasn't seen during training.
