# Computer Vision Basics

## Introduction

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It enables machines to extract meaningful information from images and videos.

## Key Concepts

### Image Classification
Categorizing entire images into predefined classes (e.g., cat, dog, car).

### Object Detection
Identifying and locating objects within images, including their positions and classes.

### Image Segmentation
Dividing images into segments to identify and understand what's in different parts of the image.

### Feature Extraction
Identifying important characteristics or patterns in images.

## Applications in Development

### 1. Satellite Imagery Analysis
- Monitor deforestation
- Track urban development
- Assess agricultural conditions
- Disaster damage assessment

### 2. Medical Imaging
- Disease detection
- X-ray analysis
- Diagnostic assistance

### 3. Quality Control
- Product inspection
- Defect detection
- Quality assurance

### 4. Security and Surveillance
- Object recognition
- Activity monitoring
- Access control

## Common Techniques

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Deep learning models specifically designed for image processing.

### Transfer Learning
Using pre-trained models and adapting them for specific tasks.

### Image Preprocessing
- Resizing
- Normalization
- Augmentation
- Noise reduction

## Tools and Libraries

- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework
- **PyTorch**: ML framework with vision support
- **PIL/Pillow**: Image processing library
- **scikit-image**: Image processing algorithms

## Getting Started

1. Install computer vision libraries
2. Load and preprocess images
3. Choose or train a model
4. Perform analysis
5. Interpret results

## Best Practices

- Ensure image quality
- Use appropriate preprocessing
- Consider computational resources
- Validate results
- Handle edge cases
