# AI Ethics Framework

## Principles of Ethical AI

### 1. Fairness and Non-Discrimination
AI systems should treat all individuals and groups fairly, without discrimination based on protected characteristics.

**Guidelines:**
- Test for bias in training data
- Monitor for discriminatory outcomes
- Ensure diverse representation
- Regular bias audits

### 2. Transparency and Explainability
AI systems should be transparent about how they work and provide explanations for their decisions.

**Guidelines:**
- Document model development process
- Provide clear explanations
- Disclose limitations
- Enable user understanding

### 3. Privacy and Data Protection
AI systems must respect privacy and protect personal data.

**Guidelines:**
- Minimize data collection
- Secure data storage
- Obtain informed consent
- Comply with regulations

### 4. Accountability
Organizations using AI should be accountable for their systems' decisions and impacts.

**Guidelines:**
- Clear responsibility chains
- Regular monitoring
- Impact assessments
- Remediation processes

### 5. Human Oversight
AI systems should have appropriate human oversight and control.

**Guidelines:**
- Human-in-the-loop processes
- Override capabilities
- Regular reviews
- Human decision-making for critical choices
