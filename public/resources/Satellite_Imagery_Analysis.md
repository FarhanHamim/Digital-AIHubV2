# Satellite Imagery Analysis Guide

## Overview

Satellite imagery analysis uses computer vision and AI to extract meaningful information from satellite images for development purposes.

## Applications

### Agriculture Monitoring
- Crop health assessment
- Yield prediction
- Irrigation planning
- Pest detection

### Environmental Monitoring
- Deforestation tracking
- Water body monitoring
- Land use classification
- Climate change impact

### Urban Planning
- Urban growth tracking
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Population density estimation
- Disaster risk assessment

## Analysis Techniques

### 1. Land Cover Classification
Identifying and categorizing different types of land cover (forest, water, urban, etc.).

### 2. Change Detection
Comparing images over time to identify changes in land use or conditions.

### 3. Object Detection
Identifying specific objects like buildings, roads, or water bodies.

### 4. Vegetation Index Analysis
Using indices like NDVI to assess vegetation health.

## Tools and Platforms

### Free Platforms
- Google Earth Engine
- Sentinel Hub
- QGIS with plugins

### Commercial Platforms
- ArcGIS
- ENVI
- ERDAS IMAGINE

### Programming Tools
- Python: Rasterio, GDAL, scikit-image
- R: raster, terra packages

## Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtain satellite imagery
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare images
3. **Analysis**: Apply computer vision techniques
4. **Interpretation**: Extract meaningful insights
5. **Visualization**: Create maps and reports

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Crop Monitoring
Using satellite imagery to monitor crop health and predict yields in agricultural development programs.

### Case Study 2: Deforestation Tracking
Monitoring forest cover changes to support conservation efforts.

### Case Study 3: Urban Growth Analysis
Tracking urban expansion to inform planning and infrastructure development.

## Best Practices

- Choose appropriate satellite resolution
- Consider cloud cover
- Validate with ground truth data
- Use appropriate time series
- Consider seasonal variations
