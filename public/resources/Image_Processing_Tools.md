# Image Processing Tools Guide

## Overview

This guide covers tools and techniques for processing and analyzing images using computer vision and AI.

## Image Processing Steps

### 1. Loading Images
Load images from various sources:
- Local files
- URLs
- Databases
- APIs

### 2. Preprocessing
Prepare images for analysis:
- Resizing
- Cropping
- Normalization
- Color space conversion
- Noise reduction

### 3. Feature Extraction
Extract meaningful features:
- Edges
- Corners
- Textures
- Shapes
- Colors

### 4. Analysis
Perform analysis:
- Classification
- Detection
- Segmentation
- Recognition

## Tools by Category

### General Purpose
- **OpenCV**: Comprehensive computer vision library
- **PIL/Pillow**: Python imaging library
- **scikit-image**: Image processing algorithms

### Deep Learning
- **TensorFlow**: With Keras for image models
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **FastAI**: High-level deep learning library

### Specialized
- **Tesseract**: OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- **YOLO**: Object detection
- **Detectron2**: Object detection and segmentation

## Common Tasks

### Image Classification
Categorize images into classes using CNNs or pre-trained models.

### Object Detection
Identify and locate objects in images.

### Image Segmentation
Divide images into meaningful segments.

### OCR
Extract text from images.

## Getting Started

1. Install required libraries
