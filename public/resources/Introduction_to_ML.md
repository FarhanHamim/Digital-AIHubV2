# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The focus is on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs. Common applications include:
- Classification (e.g., spam detection)
- Regression (e.g., price prediction)

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Common applications include:
- Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

## Key Steps in ML Projects

1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly define what you want to predict or classify
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data for training
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms
5. **Training**: Train the model on your data
6. **Evaluation**: Test the model's performance
7. **Deployment**: Use the model in production
8. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor and improve

## Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous values
- **Decision Trees**: For classification and regression
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines**: For classification tasks
- **Neural Networks**: For complex pattern recognition

## Best Practices

- Start with simple models
- Ensure data quality
- Avoid overfitting
- Validate your models
- Consider ethical implications
- Document your work
